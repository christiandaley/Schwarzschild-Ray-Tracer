# Schwazrschild-Ray-Tracer
Accelerated ray tracing in Schwarzschild spacetime. This a research project for my master's degree in computer science.

This is rendering software for tracing curved light rays in Schwarzschild spacetime. This software is written in C++ 
for Ubuntu and relies on the libpng, png++, and pthread libraries.

See "report.pdf" for more details.
